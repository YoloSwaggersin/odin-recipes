        <h2>Baked Stuffed Bell Peppers with Rice and Beef</h2>

        <p>
            In this dish, we'll be removing the top of each bell pepper to stuff it. Before this, we need to cook<br>
            what we'll be stuffing it with. After browning your ground beef (or honestly whatever protein you want)<br>
            and cooking up your rice, you can mix them together with some cheese and fill each decapitated pepper<br>
            with this and some shredded cheese. You can also top it with some mozzarella if you want to make a big<br>
            impact. After lining them up on a baking tray with some water, we set them in the oven to melt the<br>
            cheese and cook the peppers, which also lets the flavor of the meat disperse. When you're done, it's a<br>
            good idea to garnish with some greens to bring out the other colors.<br>
            <br>
            In my opinion, this is a very easy recipe for any first timers. It teaches you the fundamentals of a<br>
            lot of dishes. Browning some meat and cooking some rice are fundamentals, and teaching that something<br>
            as simple as cheese can bring a dish together is something that shouldn't be understated. On top of<br>
            all of that, it's really good! The possibilities for experimentation are wide, go nuts.
