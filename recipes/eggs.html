            Eggs might be the first thing anyone learns how to cook. I remember it was for me, and I somehow thought<br>
            it would be a good idea to place my entire palm on the hot stove top. Funny times, awful smell. That might<br>
            or might not have been my moment of waking up in the world. Anyway, it's so easy to do this one! Maybe the<br>
            hardest part for a beginner would be making sure not to get any egg shell in the finished product, but if<br>
            you're having trouble, always remember that the internet is like a huge library. Someone has written<br>
            something on how to break an egg perfectly every time. Butter that pan, crack those eggs in, and don't<br>
            forget to throw the cheese in right before you take it out so that it doesn't burn.
